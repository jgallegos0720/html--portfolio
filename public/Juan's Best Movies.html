 <h1>Best movies according to me, Juan Gallegos</h1>
<h2>Top movies of 2025</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Superman</h3>
<p>One of my favorites of this year because of a lot of action and it was funny. I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I diddue to the last movie</p>

<h3>Fantastic 4</h3>
<p>This movie sucked, there's not a lot of action but I did like the scenery of the movie and I enjoyedseeing Galactus on the big screen and a female Silver Surfer that was cool too.</p>

<h3>Elio</h3>
<p>This movie was not just enjoyable for myself but also good for the kids.</p>
